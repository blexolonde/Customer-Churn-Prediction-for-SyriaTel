# Customer Churn Prediction for SyriaTel

## üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for **SyriaTel**, a telecommunications company. Churn prediction is essential for reducing customer loss and improving retention strategies. The goal is to build a classification model that can identify at-risk customers before they leave the service.

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains **customer information, usage patterns, and churn labels**. It includes **demographics, service plan details, call usage statistics, and customer service interactions**. The target variable is **"churn"**, which indicates whether a customer has left the company (1 = churned, 0 = stayed).  

The dataset includes the following key features:  

### **Customer Demographics**  
- `state`: The U.S. state where the customer resides.  
- `account length`: Duration (in days) the customer has been with the company.  

### **Service Plans**  
- `international plan`: Whether the customer has an international calling plan (Yes/No).  
- `voice mail plan`: Whether the customer has a voicemail plan (Yes/No).  

### **Usage Metrics**  
- number vmail messages: Number of voicemail messages.  
- total day minutes, total day calls, total day charge: Daytime call usage.  
- total eve minutes, total eve calls, total eve charge: Evening call usage.  
- total night minutes, total night calls, total night charge: Nighttime call usage.  
- total intl minutes, total intl calls, total intl charge: International call usage.  

### **Customer Service Interactions**  
- customer service calls: Number of calls made to customer service.  

### **Target Variable**  
- churn: Whether the customer has churned (1) or not (0).

## üéØ Objective

- Develop and evaluate machine learning models to predict customer churn.
- Identify key features that influence churn.
- Provide actionable insights to help reduce churn.

---

## üìä Data Preprocessing

- **Feature Engineering**: Transformed and combined categorical and numerical features to improve model performance.
- **Handling Class Imbalance**: Applied **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to address class imbalance and prevent the model from favoring the majority class.
- **Encoding & Scaling**: Used **one-hot encoding** for categorical variables and **MinMax scaling** for numerical features.

## üèÜ Machine Learning Models

## **Machine Learning Models Used**
The following models were trained and evaluated:
1. **Random Forest Classifier**
2. **XGBoost Classifier** (Best-performing model)

### **Performance Metrics**
- **ROC-AUC Score**: Measures model discrimination between churners and non-churners.
  - **XGBoost AUC:** 0.8857
  - **Random Forest AUC:** 0.8722
- **Confusion Matrix** (for XGBoost):
  - True Positives: **69** (Churners correctly identified)
  - False Positives: **8** (Non-churners incorrectly classified as churners)
  - True Negatives: **563** (Correctly identified non-churners)
  - False Negatives: **27** (Churners incorrectly classified as non-churners)
- **Precision-Recall Curve**: XGBoost demonstrated better precision and recall, making it the preferred model.

## üöÄ Business Impact & Recommendations

1. **Retention Strategy Optimization**:
   - Focus retention efforts on customers with high churn probability (as identified by the model).
   - Improve customer experience for users making frequent customer service calls.
2. **Service Plan Enhancements**:
   - Customers with **no voice mail plans** have a higher churn risk‚Äîconsider promotions to encourage adoption.
   - International plan subscribers show varying churn behavior‚Äîoptimize offers based on usage trends.
3. **Predictive Monitoring**:
   - Deploy the XGBoost model in production to monitor churn risk in real-time.
   - Set up alerts for customers exceeding churn probability thresholds.

## üèóÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Python** (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **GridSearchCV & RandomizedSearchCV** (for hyperparameter tuning)
